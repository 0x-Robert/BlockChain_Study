Ballot*.sol files: The four files with Ballot versions are complete Solidity files that can be loaded into Remix IDE and tested.


BallotV1.sol: Define the data structures for the smart contract.

BallotV2.sol: Add the constructor and the function to change the state of voting.

BallotV3.sol: Add a modifier to illustrate the use of Solidity features for enabling trust.

BallotV4.sol: Add other trust elements require(), revert() assert() and a the function access modifier.â€‹


Listing3.X files: (7 files) Illustrate the technique and Solidity feature added in the incremental development of the Ballot solution that is described in the chapter.

Listing 3.1: Only data items. Same as BallotV1.sol
Listing 3.2: Voting states added. Same as BallotV2.sol
Listing 3.3: Modifier definition and example
Listing 3.4: Illustrates use of a modifier
Listing 3.5: Use of modifier validPhase of voting.(BallotV3.sol)
Listing 3.6: One more modifier onlyChair can register
Listing 3.7: Solution with all trust rules coded (BallotV4.sol)
